# reset-generations.sh — clean old NixOS generations + RENUMBER the profile back to 1.
#
# WHY IT'S NEEDED: every `nixos-rebuild switch` adds one generation
# (/nix/var/nix/profiles/system-<N>-link). Nix assigns the next number as
# **largest remaining number + 1**, so deleting generations alone does NOT
# lower the number — to get back to 1 the remaining link must be renamed.
#
# The script does 4 things:
#   1. Delete every generation except the running one (`nix-env --delete-generations old`).
#   2. Rename the remaining `system-<N>-link` to `system-1-link` and point the
#      `system` symlink at it => the next rebuild becomes generation 2, then 3, 4...
#   3. `nixos-rebuild switch` to create generation 2 and rewrite the boot entry. The
#      systemd-boot builder DELETES ALL `nixos*` entries in /boot/loader/entries then
#      rewrites them from the current generation list => old entries clean themselves
#      up, no manual deletion needed.
#   4. `nix-collect-garbage -d` — reclaim store space from old generations.
#
# ⚠️ AFTER RUNNING YOU CANNOT ROLL BACK to older versions (permanently deleted).
#    Remaining safety net: generation 1 (the running one) + `configurationLimit`
#    (boot menu keeps 10 entries) + weekly automatic GC (`--delete-older-than 7d`).
#
# 2 mandatory safety checks, enforced by the script:
#   • /boot must be mounted — otherwise step 3 dies at "Failed to install
#     bootloader" (this actually happened when /etc/fstab held another machine's UUID).
#   • Never leave 0 generations — the systemd-boot builder refuses to run and
#     exits 1 when the generation list is empty.
#
# Usage:  sudo bash scripts/reset-generations.sh [flake-dir] [host]
#         defaults: flake-dir = parent dir of the script, host = laptop
